You will find on this website link to lecture slides, exercises including some solutions, and link to the class video recordings.


## Session Format
The module has 10 sessions, each of 80 minutes. The standard format for a session is approximately:

* 45 minutes of lecture material that will be recorded via Zoom live and posted at the end of the day
* 30 minutes of exercises for you to try, with small-group "breakout" Zoom sessions available, attended by other class participants, and Teaching Assistants
* 15 minute discussion of exercises, where the instructors will present possible solutions and answer questions

Please join the module's [Slack channel](www.expage.com), where you can ask questions and see real-time updates from the instructors and TAs.
Each session builds on previous sessions so you will get maximum benefit by attending every session live and in sequence.
